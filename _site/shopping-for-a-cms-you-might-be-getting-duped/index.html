  <article class="post-content">
  <p>You create a product. You market it. You sell it. Duh, right? Everybody’s gotta eat. But there’s are things being said in day-to-day my-CMS-is-better-than-your-CMS discussions and marketing that I consider pretty misleading. In hopes that this will help at least one poor Googling soul who knows next to nothing about content management systems but has been tasked with choosing the next one his or her company will use for the new website, I’m going to air this out.</p>

<p>I’ve worked with a lot of the big ones, and I can promise you things. Listen.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-debate">The big debate.</h2>
<p>As I’ve alluded to, us Web peeps tend to have our favorite content management systems – the one that’s most fun to code for, easiest to extend, does the most work for us – the ‘why’ is moot. We have favorites, even if we say we don’t, and even if we will always choose the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>We are passionate about our choice, and tend to defend it like we do other things we’re passionate about – our choice of personal computer (love my Macs, nose-up to the naysayers), our favorite car (I will duel you if you bash my Mustangs), our family (I will WRECK you). Sometimes, when one  defends one’s favorite something, seeing through the feels makes you to say stupid things.</p>

<p>Drupal vs. WordPress vs. Joomla vs. Concrete5 vs. Magento vs. Jekyll vs. [insert your favorite underdog here] – all have strengths and weaknesses. We can stab at each other’s favorite until we’re blue in the face and exactly nobody has changed their minds. </p>

<p>It’s relatively easy to identify a passionate Web nerd and see it for what it is, but there’s another factoid-spewer lurking in plain sight. It’s the marketing people trying to drive adoption of their system over the others.</p>

<p>I’ve certainly got nothing against businesses marketing. Do what you’ve gotta do. What I take issue with is the sometimes subtle, misleading language that the decision makers at companies around the world may be affected by.</p>

<h2 id="how-am-i-getting-duped">How am I getting duped?</h2>
<p>There’s one marketing habit in particular that drives me insane. I stumbled across a CMS I hadn’t heard of. It seems to be popular with the big agencies around the world. I don’t even remember the name, to be honest.</p>

<p>The thing to be hesitant of are any generic claims that a specific CMS is ‘always 100% standards-compliant HTML5’ or ‘100% responsive.’ Anything like that is likely to be complete dupery.</p>

<p>It might not even be on its website. It could be in an affiliate’s blog/site, tweet, etc. The reason it’s dupery is that once you or the team you’ve hired get to building your site, these are features that they must implement.</p>

<p>While a CMS-based site COULD be compliant, responsive and the like (a good CMS should have fallback templates) once we begin theming, templating, writing extensions and the like, it’s up to us to produce proper markup. As we customize our site, we create, edit and/or repurpose template files. If the main selling point was this responsiveness or HTML5 awesomeness and your devs created a front end featuring neither, you’ve been duped, and tens of thousands of dollars later, no doubt.</p>

<p>Note that any claims about the admin dashboard and other areas that users and customers don’t see are likely valid. As developers, we rarely do anything to disrupt the structure/look of the back end admin area when building with a CMS. This part of the site is entirely separate from the public side, and exists solely for adding content and otherwise administrating the site.</p>
