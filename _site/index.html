      <p class="author">

      <div class="content">
        <p>When I started at General Data, I began building the company’s new website with Drupal 7, and assumed nothing. Any precaution I could think to take, I took.</p>

<p>One such precaution was how I initialized the database. When you install Drupal, you’re asked whether you want to prefix the table names in the database for your site. This is a handy little convenience if you might be using this database for other applications that may or may not want to ignore the Drupal tables therein. If you set your DB prefix to <code>my_site_</code>, anytime Drupal creates a table (at installation or otherwise) it’ll append <code>my_site_</code> to the front of it.</p>

<p>This way, Drupal’s tables will look like <code>my_site_node</code>, and if another application using the same database needs to create/use a table called <code>node	</code>, all is quiet on the western front. Drupal’s tables are all namespaced because you chose a prefix. If you chose a prefix that a module you’re installing also uses, you’ve got a problem, but that’s another story.</p>

<p>Seems like a legit precaution to take, but I happened to run into a case where my table prefix prevented me from installing something I needed and had to disappear. Nobody wants to rename a bunch of tables manually, so I found a script online that did the trick. Thing was, it was written for Drupal 6, as D7 was still quite youthful at the time.</p>

<p>I tweaked a line or two to get it to work for Drupal 7, and here it is. Credit goes to the <a href="http://openleafstudios.com/blog/remove-database-prefix-existing-drupal-site">Open Leaf</a> gang for doing the heavy lifting here.</p>

<p>This script is meant to be run via Drush. If you’re not familiar with Drush, get there. It’s awesome, and it makes me wish every Web framework/CMS came with a robust command line utility.</p>

<p>As always, back up that database before doing anything else.</p>

    <h1><a href="/how-the-internet-works" class="title">In a nutshell: How the internet works</a></h1>
      <p class="author">
        <span class="post-date">Feb 7, 2014</span>
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>I’m generally told I do a solid job of explaining technical things to newcomers, so I thought I’d do some introductory breakdowns of the various parts of Web development in hopes that I can help some friends and wandering Googlers.</p>

<p>A great place to start is with Web servers. The internet is just a crapload of computers and other devices (phones, tablets, etc.) connecting to one another across a crapload of networks. The deep mechanics behind how our computers talk to each other isn’t important for diving into webdev, but there’s a part that is crucial to beginning to code dynamic websites.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard the term ‘server’ by now. The word can be intimidating, but it’s not as angry as it may seem in pop culture. Technically, the Web server is software sitting on a computer somewhere, waiting for you to send it a request. Apache, IIS and Nginx are the three you see a lot. I’m using Nginx to serve this very website. By default, Nginx and its peers will ‘listen’ on a certain port for incoming requests. A request is made when you type a URL into a browser. You’re asking for a website, and the server, well, serves it up.</p>

<p>If you’re using a desktop computer to view this site, you can literally install free server software on the machine you’re using, start the server, create an HTML document and other devices on your home network can view it by typing your IP address into their favorite browser. The word ‘server’ is also often used interchangeably to describe the hardware (the computer itself) or both at the same time. “We’ve got 12 servers in our IT room” would more than likely be referring to the whole machines, not the software they’re running.</p>

<p>So when you open your browser and type in google.com, your browser talks to the nearest DNS server, which contains the IP address for Google. Once it’s got that IP, it finds the actual server where Google’s waiting for you. Once it sees your request, it sees that you’re going to the main page, and sends you the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that make up that main page. Your browser literally downloads these files, and the pretty page is put together right in front of you.</p>

<h2 id="server-side-stuff">Server-side stuff</h2>

<p>Web browsers used to be pretty terrible. Hell, computers were, too. Just a few years ago, when we wanted a page to be dynamic – think of your profile picture popping up on Facebook – all of that processing would happen on the server before the page you requested was sent back to you.</p>

<p>A good example of this is your Facebook homepage. Even though many people are at www.facebook.com, what you see is completely unique. You see your friends’ posts, targeted advertising, groups you’re in, messages, etc. While the way Facebook does this is much more sophisticated, early dynamic websites did most of this magic on the server before the page ever loaded into your browser.</p>

<p>Languages like PHP and Python run on the server before any pages are sent. This can be animated by some easy-to-read code. Let’s pretend we have a super simple page that just greets the logged-in user. The HTML that would end up on your screen would look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Hello, Joe!<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>But it’d be silly to create individual pages like this with each user’s name. That’d get messy very quickly. Instead, we do some processing on the server to grab the name of the logged in user. Let’s do a mixture of PHP and comments where PHP would be to articulate this a bit.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="c1">// ^~That&#39;s the opening PHP tag. The server&#39;s going to execute all of the code within these tags.</span>
<span class="c1">//The &#39;//&#39;&#39; tells the server to ignore this line. It&#39;s a comment.</span>

<span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">getUserFirstName</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="c1">// We&#39;ll pretend code is here that grabs the currently logged-in user&#39;s username from the database and throws it into a variable called $firstName. Then we&#39;ll return it. In coding, we often use functions to contain code we&#39;ll want to run multiple times from elsewhere in our application.</span>

	<span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">$firstName</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// Variable names can be whatever we want, though you want to give them names that make sense.</span>
<span class="nv">$cheeseburger</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">getUserFirstName</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1">//We called our function and put it into a variable. Now we drop it into our content.</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>

<span class="x">&lt;h1&gt;Hello, </span><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nv">$cheeseburger</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"> &lt;/h1&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The resulting HTML would look exactly like that last snippet where I hardcoded my name into the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag. Notice there can be as many PHP blocks in one document as you need. If we pretend this file is called <code>myname.php</code> and it’s on this very website, you could visit joecastelli.com/myname.php, the PHP code would run on the server, then simple HTML would appear in the document that lands in your browser.</p>

<p>As the Web has evolved, this has shifted a bit. JavaScript is often being used on the client (your browser) to perform tasks servers used to handle alone. </p>

<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>

<p>The combination of HTML, CSS and a server-side language like PHP was pretty much the way of the world for a while there. Once you requested <code>myname.php</code>, your computer was pretty much done talking to the server until you requested another page. There were few cases where the page would update without refreshing, which is a feature of many sites we’ve grown quite accustomed to recently.</p>

<p>JavaScript is the language that runs in the browser. It can move things around, count stuff, change things, store data, and do pretty much anything PHP or Python can, but in your browser. HTML alone doesn’t do much outside of suppply content and structure:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Hello, Joe!<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>This is just a paragraph sitting in a paragraph tag.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Adding CSS makes it prettier, not smarter:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">h1</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">100</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">30px</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">font-family</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">Helvetica</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">Arial</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="k">sans-serif</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">purple</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">p</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="k">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">gray</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">14px</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>By themselves, they’re pretty stupid. With JavaScript, the possibilities are endless. Let’s do some stuff so you can see what I mean. For this little playtime, you’ll need to be on a desktop or laptop computer using Firefox or Chrome to view this web page.</p>

<p>Right click anywhere on the page and click ‘Inspect Element.’ In the drawer that pops up, look at the top for ‘Console’ and click that. From here, we can run whatever JavaScript we want. Look for the little prompt – <code>&gt;</code> – as that’s where we’re about to type. In Firefox, it’ll be at the bottom of that drawer. In Chrome, it’ll be at the top of the white space, but below anything that’s already been output (errors, messages, etc.).</p>

<p>Once you’re there, paste in <code>alert('testing');</code> and hit Enter. <code>alert()</code> is one of the many functions that come baked in with JavaScript.</p>

<p>For this site, I’m also loading jQuery, which is just a JavaScript framework. It brings a lot of cool stuff to the table, including some animation funcitons. Let’s wreck some things with jQuery before we wrap this one up.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="c1">// Calling the jQuery function slideUp() on every &lt;p&gt; tag on this page.</span>
<span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;p&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">slideUp</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1">// This next line will refresh the entire page after eight seconds, undoing our mess so you can come back to the last paragraph here.</span>
<span class="nx">setTimeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;window.location.reload()&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8000</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></div>

<p>You can do this on any number of sites. Try it on Pinterest, but replace the ‘p’ with ‘img’ to make all the images disappear. So now you’re equipped to trick someone into thinking you’re an evil hacker! The thing is, if a given site is NOT using jQuery, this won’t fly.</p>

<p>Notice that reloading the page removed our hackery. That’s because we only changed the document that was loaded into our browser, not the actual file on my server.</p>

<p>I just threw a lot at the wall, but I’m putting this post down for now. Feel free to comment with any questions, requests for new posts, or just to drop a hello!</p>

      <p class="author">
        <span class="post-date">Jan 4, 2014</span>
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>When I first began really diving into Web development, the lack of a clear starting point was staggering. All I could do was latch on to what I understood, read a lot, and research the terms that’d come up that I’d never even heard before. </p>

<p>I took two courses in college that I’d argue to be my cornerstone: System administration I, and System administration II. Being a sysadmin in the real world pretty much means maintaining the servers and other infrastructure upon which other people – developers in particular – rely. The thing about these courses that gave me such a fantastic head start was the deep education on the command line interface of *nix-like operating systems.</p>

<p>No matter what operating system you use on a day-to-day basis, most people interact with a user interface that makes life breezy. Drag something into the trash can, empty it sometimes. Click ‘File,’ then ‘New File’ to create a new document. Double click an icon to open a file in the program it was created with. You get my drift.</p>

<p>Under the hood, these actions are being translated into lower-level commands that you can issue yourself, bypassing the UI entirely. You can open a session in your terminal – you can find the ‘Terminal’ program on OS X – maneuver into a folder, create a new one inside it, create a file inside of that, then add text to that file.</p>

<p>Let’s say you want to create a new folder on your desktop and create a few files within it. Rather than right click, fumble with naming/renaming, a few commands will get us where we need to be. On OS X:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># Change directory into my Desktop</span>
<span class="c">## Note: The tilde(~) represents your home directory, which, in *nix systems, is completely unique for all users</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Desktop

<span class="c"># Now that my working directory is my desktop, let&#39;s make my new folder</span>
mkdir newFolder

<span class="c"># Let&#39;s verify the folder has been created by listing the contents of the Desktop</span>
ls -al

<span class="c"># We can see our new folder. Let&#39;s change into it</span>
<span class="nb">cd </span>newFolder

<span class="c"># Now let&#39;s create a few text files that we can come back to and edit later</span>
touch my-diary.txt foo.txt bar.txt

<span class="c"># Now let&#39;s list the contents of our new folder to ensure our files were created</span>
ls -al</code></pre></div>

<p>At face value, this seems entirely pointless. Why learn commands to do this sort of thing? For starters, you could toss all these commands into a script, add a bit more code and run it on a schedule, creating new folders with files inside them. Similar things are often done in the real world to create log files that we can look back upon when things break.</p>

<p>The thing is, these basic commands are only a start. The tools available to a savvy user are incredibly powerful. Have you ever wanted to separate the videos and images on an SD card into separate folders in one swoop? Maybe find all files in a folder than contain the word ‘taxes?’ You can also build an entire Web application using only the command line. In fact, I have several developer friends who do just that.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t have a book or nerdfriend handy, you can see the ‘manual’ for almost any command by using the <code>man</code> command.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">man ls<span class="p">;</span>
man <span class="nb">cd</span><span class="p">;</span>
man touch<span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c"># Each of the above commands will output a manual for the following command.</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Learning your way around a Linux or Mac command line can ultimately lead to a better day-to-day computing experience. Take it for a spin!</p>
