        <p>As I’ve said in <a href="/shopping-for-a-cms-you-might-be-getting-duped" title="Click here to see my older post about CMS decisions">a previous post about content management systems</a>, we can tussle over which is best until we turn purple.</p>

<p>I’ve worked with quite a few by now, and here’s a quick rundown on some of them, and why I like them. I’ll try to revisit this post from time-to-time as things evolve.</p>

<h2 id="drupaldrupal"><a href="https://www.drupal.org/" title="Learn more about Drupal">Drupal</a></h2>
<p>Drupal remains my favorite CMS, hands down. It hasn’t historically been the most pleasant to work with at all times, but it’s steadily improving, and my early experience with Drupal 8 has been awesome.</p>

<p>A lower-level tool than many systems, Drupal straddles the line between CMS and pure PHP framework. It’s extremely developer friendly, and you can build anything from a standard site to a Twitter clone using Drupal and some custom code.</p>

<p>Throw in an awesome community with very active IRC channels, a slew of modules that are completely free to install and a security team constantly identifying issues in contrib – Drupal takes the cake, in my book.</p>

<h2 id="wordpresswp"><a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="Learn more about WordPress">WordPress</a></h2>
<p>Not a distant second by any means, WordPress sports a fantastic community, a wealth of free, open source plugins and  the prettiest admin interface in the game. If your WordPress site is built by someone who knows what they’re doing, adding content will always be a great experience.</p>

<p>As a developer, WP is the easiest CMS to build with, but I find its blog-first roots to be a bit odd when coming back from other systems sometimes. In short, WP has its way of coding, Drupal has its own, and I find Drupal’s approach to be the most flexible and enjoyable to code for.</p>

<p>When I do a new WordPress theme from scratch, I like to start with Roots. It brings a lot of awesome to the table and helps me feel a bit more at home.</p>

<p>If you just need a basic website with a blog, you can’t go wrong with WP. If your site’s going to be larger, need serious custom functionality (customer portals, paywall content and the like) at some point, WordPress may not be the ideal choice.</p>

<p>WordPress also gets bonus points as the one I personally recommend for people interested in learning how to code. As a webdev, it’s where I truly got my start.</p>

<h2 id="jekylljekyll"><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Learn more about Jekyll">Jekyll</a></h2>
<p>Jekyll isn’t technically a CMS, but it helps me manage and publish content, so I’ll call it one anyway. It’s a static site generator. You build templates, create Markdown files containing your content and generate your site.</p>

<p>You can’t use it to handle form submissions. You can’t have users logging in. You’ve got to be a bit geeky to work with it, and you’d have to mix it with other solutions to get any server-side interactivity.</p>

<p>Why use Jekyll, then? Glad you asked. Speed. Speed is the answer. Jekyll is ridiculously fast because the server isn’t running any app code to serve pages. They’re all already there, as though you made each one individually in Dreamweaver or something. This is pretty much what Web servers were originally designed to do, and they do it well.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/" title="An article on how page load times can affect your conversions">Studies have shown</a> that the longer your site takes to load, the greater the chance that you will not convert that user, whether your CTA is to buy something or subscribe to a newsletter. People like fast sh*t.</p>

<p>Also, this is as easy to design for as a platform can be. You can create a base HTML file that looks exactly how you want your website to look and Jekyllize it very quickly.</p>

<p>This site is built with Jekyll. Combine that with SSD hosting at DigitalOcean and things are pretty damn snappy, no? As such, Jekyll’s my new recommendation for any situation where it can possibly fit, even for cases where it needs to be shoehorned just a little.</p>

<p>For bonus reading, see <a href="http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform" title="A blog detailing a serious, real-world Jekyll deployment">how Obama’s campaign website leveraged Jekyll to increase conversions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="concrete5concrete5"><a href="http://www.concrete5.org/" title="Learn more about concrete5">concrete5</a></h2>
<p>Concrete5 is another one I’ve seen gain more traction recently, so I’d taken it for a spin. I’d describe it as a balance between Jekyll and other systems. It was among the first I’m aware of to feature in-context editing, which is especially cool when building a site for people who consider themselves especially computer illiterate.</p>

<p>The thing that makes it Jekylly is the speed with which you can go from design to website. It’s another pretty easy templating system, at least for getting a basic setup going. Definitely worth taking for a spin.</p>

<p>It’s the add-ons that turn me off. Even glancing at its marketplace of add-ons now, I’m seeing open source software repackaged for concrete and being sold for $50. I’m not wiring it up to try, so there may be serious added value that’s worth the money, but this is a far cry from what I’m accustomed to.</p>

<h2 id="joomlajoomla"><a href="http://www.joomla.org/" title="Learn more about Joomla!">Joomla!</a></h2>
<p>Joomla! is another big one. I’ll admit, it’s been a long while since I’ve worked with it. It’s always felt a little dirty to me. Drupal’s documentation is great (or maybe I’ve gotten used to it), save for the occasional unfinished page. The WordPress documentation has always been legendary. Joomla!’s has always been fragmented and underwhelming when I’ve looked for it. That’s bad.</p>

<p>One bonus I gather from Joomla! is it’s supposed to be pretty flexible, but I’ve never tried using it that way, and can’t speak to its APIs and such.</p>

<p>I’d love to have a conversation with a Joomla! expert who could explain what he sees in it, but as it stands I can’t recommend Joomla! over Drupal or WordPress. That may be entirely because of my lack of experience with the CMS, so don’t take my word for it.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-sharepointshit"><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/" title="Learn more about Sharepoint">Microsoft Sharepoint</a></h2>
<p>Sharepoint kinda makes me want to puke. I haven’t had to do much with it, but what I did have to do was a bad experience.  It’s always seemed like a confused product, but that was with a pretty ancient version. It looks like it’s improved a bit.</p>

<p>I don’t do much Microsoft dev these days, so if you or your team does, Sharepoint may be exactly what you want. It’s an especially great option if you’re building for a company that’s already deep into Microsoft products and you need to integrate. But this is definitely not the platform you’d choose for a blog…</p>

    <h1><a href="/remove-db-prefixes-drupal-7" class="title">Drupal 7: Remove database prefixes</a></h1>
      <p class="author">
        <span class="post-date">Jun 19, 2014</span>
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>When I started at General Data, I began building the company’s new website with Drupal 7, and assumed nothing. Any precaution I could think to take, I took.</p>

<p>One such precaution was how I initialized the database. When you install Drupal, you’re asked whether you want to prefix the table names in the database for your site. This is a handy little convenience if you might be using this database for other applications that may or may not want to ignore the Drupal tables therein. If you set your DB prefix to <code>my_site_</code>, anytime Drupal creates a table (at installation or otherwise) it’ll append <code>my_site_</code> to the front of it.</p>

<p>This way, Drupal’s tables will look like <code>my_site_node</code>, and if another application using the same database needs to create/use a table called <code>node	</code>, all is quiet on the western front. Drupal’s tables are all namespaced because you chose a prefix. If you chose a prefix that a module you’re installing also uses, you’ve got a problem, but that’s another story.</p>

<p>Seems like a legit precaution to take, but I happened to run into a case where my table prefix prevented me from installing something I needed and had to disappear. Nobody wants to rename a bunch of tables manually, so I found a script online that did the trick. Thing was, it was written for Drupal 6, as D7 was still quite youthful at the time.</p>

<p>I tweaked a line or two to get it to work for Drupal 7, and here it is. Credit goes to the <a href="http://openleafstudios.com/blog/remove-database-prefix-existing-drupal-site">Open Leaf</a> gang for doing the heavy lifting here.</p>

<p>This script is meant to be run via Drush. If you’re not familiar with Drush, get there. It’s awesome, and it makes me wish every Web framework/CMS came with a robust command line utility.</p>

<p>As always, back up that database before doing anything else.</p>

      <p class="author">
        <span class="post-date">Jun 7, 2014</span>

      <div class="content">
        <p>You create a product. You market it. You sell it. Duh, right? Everybody’s gotta eat. But there’s are things being said in day-to-day my-CMS-is-better-than-your-CMS discussions and marketing that I consider pretty misleading. In hopes that this will help at least one poor Googling soul who knows next to nothing about content management systems but has been tasked with choosing the next one his or her company will use for the new website, I’m going to air this out.</p>

<p>I’ve worked with a lot of the big ones, and I can promise you things. Listen.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-debate">The big debate.</h2>
<p>As I’ve alluded to, us Web peeps tend to have our favorite content management systems – the one that’s most fun to code for, easiest to extend, does the most work for us – the ‘why’ is moot. We have favorites, even if we say we don’t, and even if we will always choose the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>We are passionate about our choice, and tend to defend it like we do other things we’re passionate about – our choice of personal computer (love my Macs, nose-up to the naysayers), our favorite car (I will duel you if you bash my Mustangs), our family (I will WRECK you). Sometimes, when one  defends one’s favorite something, seeing through the feels makes you to say stupid things.</p>

<p>Drupal vs. WordPress vs. Joomla vs. Concrete5 vs. Magento vs. Jekyll vs. [insert your favorite underdog here] – all have strengths and weaknesses. We can stab at each other’s favorite until we’re blue in the face and exactly nobody has changed their minds. </p>

<p>It’s relatively easy to identify a passionate Web nerd and see it for what it is, but there’s another factoid-spewer lurking in plain sight. It’s the marketing people trying to drive adoption of their system over the others.</p>

<p>I’ve certainly got nothing against businesses marketing. Do what you’ve gotta do. What I take issue with is the sometimes subtle, misleading language that the decision makers at companies around the world may be affected by.</p>

<h2 id="how-am-i-getting-duped">How am I getting duped?</h2>
<p>There’s one marketing habit in particular that drives me insane. I stumbled across a CMS I hadn’t heard of. It seems to be popular with the big agencies around the world. I don’t even remember the name, to be honest.</p>

<p>The thing to be hesitant of are any generic claims that a specific CMS is ‘always 100% standards-compliant HTML5’ or ‘100% responsive.’ Anything like that is likely to be complete dupery.</p>

<p>It might not even be on its website. It could be in an affiliate’s blog/site, tweet, etc. The reason it’s dupery is that once you or the team you’ve hired get to building your site, these are features that they must implement.</p>

<p>While a CMS-based site COULD be compliant, responsive and the like (a good CMS should have fallback templates) once we begin theming, templating, writing extensions and the like, it’s up to us to produce proper markup. As we customize our site, we create, edit and/or repurpose template files. If the main selling point was this responsiveness or HTML5 awesomeness and your devs created a front end featuring neither, you’ve been duped, and tens of thousands of dollars later, no doubt.</p>

<p>Note that any claims about the admin dashboard and other areas that users and customers don’t see are likely valid. As developers, we rarely do anything to disrupt the structure/look of the back end admin area when building with a CMS. This part of the site is entirely separate from the public side, and exists solely for adding content and otherwise administrating the site.</p>

    <h1><a href="/how-the-internet-works" class="title">In a nutshell: How the internet works</a></h1>
      <p class="author">
        <span class="post-date">Feb 7, 2014</span>
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>I’m generally told I do a solid job of explaining technical things to newcomers, so I thought I’d do some introductory breakdowns of the various parts of Web development in hopes that I can help some friends and wandering Googlers.</p>

<p>A great place to start is with Web servers. The internet is just a crapload of computers and other devices (phones, tablets, etc.) connecting to one another across a crapload of networks. The deep mechanics behind how our computers talk to each other isn’t important for diving into webdev, but there’s a part that is crucial to beginning to code dynamic websites.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard the term ‘server’ by now. The word can be intimidating, but it’s not as angry as it may seem in pop culture. Technically, the Web server is software sitting on a computer somewhere, waiting for you to send it a request. Apache, IIS and Nginx are the three you see a lot. I’m using Nginx to serve this very website. By default, Nginx and its peers will ‘listen’ on a certain port for incoming requests. A request is made when you type a URL into a browser. You’re asking for a website, and the server, well, serves it up.</p>

<p>If you’re using a desktop computer to view this site, you can literally install free server software on the machine you’re using, start the server, create an HTML document and other devices on your home network can view it by typing your IP address into their favorite browser. The word ‘server’ is also often used interchangeably to describe the hardware (the computer itself) or both at the same time. “We’ve got 12 servers in our IT room” would more than likely be referring to the whole machines, not the software they’re running.</p>

<p>So when you open your browser and type in google.com, your browser talks to the nearest DNS server, which contains the IP address for Google. Once it’s got that IP, it finds the actual server where Google’s waiting for you. Once it sees your request, it sees that you’re going to the main page, and sends you the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that make up that main page. Your browser literally downloads these files, and the pretty page is put together right in front of you.</p>

<h2 id="server-side-stuff">Server-side stuff</h2>

<p>Web browsers used to be pretty terrible. Hell, computers were, too. Just a few years ago, when we wanted a page to be dynamic – think of your profile picture popping up on Facebook – all of that processing would happen on the server before the page you requested was sent back to you.</p>

<p>A good example of this is your Facebook homepage. Even though many people are at www.facebook.com, what you see is completely unique. You see your friends’ posts, targeted advertising, groups you’re in, messages, etc. While the way Facebook does this is much more sophisticated, early dynamic websites did most of this magic on the server before the page ever loaded into your browser.</p>

<p>Languages like PHP and Python run on the server before any pages are sent. This can be animated by some easy-to-read code. Let’s pretend we have a super simple page that just greets the logged-in user. The HTML that would end up on your screen would look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Hello, Joe!<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>But it’d be silly to create individual pages like this with each user’s name. That’d get messy very quickly. Instead, we do some processing on the server to grab the name of the logged in user. Let’s do a mixture of PHP and comments where PHP would be to articulate this a bit.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="c1">// ^~That&#39;s the opening PHP tag. The server&#39;s going to execute all of the code within these tags.</span>
<span class="c1">//The &#39;//&#39;&#39; tells the server to ignore this line. It&#39;s a comment.</span>

<span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">getUserFirstName</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="c1">// We&#39;ll pretend code is here that grabs the currently logged-in user&#39;s username from the database and throws it into a variable called $firstName. Then we&#39;ll return it. In coding, we often use functions to contain code we&#39;ll want to run multiple times from elsewhere in our application.</span>

	<span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">$firstName</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// Variable names can be whatever we want, though you want to give them names that make sense.</span>
<span class="nv">$cheeseburger</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">getUserFirstName</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1">//We called our function and put it into a variable. Now we drop it into our content.</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>

<span class="x">&lt;h1&gt;Hello, </span><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nv">$cheeseburger</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"> &lt;/h1&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The resulting HTML would look exactly like that last snippet where I hardcoded my name into the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag. Notice there can be as many PHP blocks in one document as you need. If we pretend this file is called <code>myname.php</code> and it’s on this very website, you could visit joecastelli.com/myname.php, the PHP code would run on the server, then simple HTML would appear in the document that lands in your browser.</p>

<p>As the Web has evolved, this has shifted a bit. JavaScript is often being used on the client (your browser) to perform tasks servers used to handle alone. </p>

<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>

<p>The combination of HTML, CSS and a server-side language like PHP was pretty much the way of the world for a while there. Once you requested <code>myname.php</code>, your computer was pretty much done talking to the server until you requested another page. There were few cases where the page would update without refreshing, which is a feature of many sites we’ve grown quite accustomed to recently.</p>

<p>JavaScript is the language that runs in the browser. It can move things around, count stuff, change things, store data, and do pretty much anything PHP or Python can, but in your browser. HTML alone doesn’t do much outside of suppply content and structure:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Hello, Joe!<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>This is just a paragraph sitting in a paragraph tag.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Adding CSS makes it prettier, not smarter:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">h1</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">100</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">30px</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">font-family</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">Helvetica</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">Arial</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="k">sans-serif</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">purple</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">p</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="k">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">gray</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">14px</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>By themselves, they’re pretty stupid. With JavaScript, the possibilities are endless. Let’s do some stuff so you can see what I mean. For this little playtime, you’ll need to be on a desktop or laptop computer using Firefox or Chrome to view this web page.</p>

<p>Right click anywhere on the page and click ‘Inspect Element.’ In the drawer that pops up, look at the top for ‘Console’ and click that. From here, we can run whatever JavaScript we want. Look for the little prompt – <code>&gt;</code> – as that’s where we’re about to type. In Firefox, it’ll be at the bottom of that drawer. In Chrome, it’ll be at the top of the white space, but below anything that’s already been output (errors, messages, etc.).</p>

<p>Once you’re there, paste in <code>alert('testing');</code> and hit Enter. <code>alert()</code> is one of the many functions that come baked in with JavaScript.</p>

<p>For this site, I’m also loading jQuery, which is just a JavaScript framework. It brings a lot of cool stuff to the table, including some animation funcitons. Let’s wreck some things with jQuery before we wrap this one up.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="c1">// Calling the jQuery function slideUp() on every &lt;p&gt; tag on this page.</span>
<span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;p&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">slideUp</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1">// This next line will refresh the entire page after eight seconds, undoing our mess so you can come back to the last paragraph here.</span>
<span class="nx">setTimeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;window.location.reload()&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8000</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></div>

<p>You can do this on any number of sites. Try it on Pinterest, but replace the ‘p’ with ‘img’ to make all the images disappear. So now you’re equipped to trick someone into thinking you’re an evil hacker! The thing is, if a given site is NOT using jQuery, this won’t fly.</p>

<p>Notice that reloading the page removed our hackery. That’s because we only changed the document that was loaded into our browser, not the actual file on my server.</p>

<p>I just threw a lot at the wall, but I’m putting this post down for now. Feel free to comment with any questions, requests for new posts, or just to drop a hello!</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>When I first began really diving into Web development, the lack of a clear starting point was staggering. All I could do was latch on to what I understood, read a lot, and research the terms that’d come up that I’d never even heard before. </p>

<p>I took two courses in college that I’d argue to be my cornerstone: System administration I, and System administration II. Being a sysadmin in the real world pretty much means maintaining the servers and other infrastructure upon which other people – developers in particular – rely. The thing about these courses that gave me such a fantastic head start was the deep education on the command line interface of *nix-like operating systems.</p>

<p>No matter what operating system you use on a day-to-day basis, most people interact with a user interface that makes life breezy. Drag something into the trash can, empty it sometimes. Click ‘File,’ then ‘New File’ to create a new document. Double click an icon to open a file in the program it was created with. You get my drift.</p>

<p>Under the hood, these actions are being translated into lower-level commands that you can issue yourself, bypassing the UI entirely. You can open a session in your terminal – you can find the ‘Terminal’ program on OS X – maneuver into a folder, create a new one inside it, create a file inside of that, then add text to that file.</p>

<p>Let’s say you want to create a new folder on your desktop and create a few files within it. Rather than right click, fumble with naming/renaming, a few commands will get us where we need to be. On OS X:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># Change directory into my Desktop</span>
<span class="c">## Note: The tilde(~) represents your home directory, which, in *nix systems, is completely unique for all users</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Desktop

<span class="c"># Now that my working directory is my desktop, let&#39;s make my new folder</span>
mkdir newFolder

<span class="c"># Let&#39;s verify the folder has been created by listing the contents of the Desktop</span>
ls -al

<span class="c"># We can see our new folder. Let&#39;s change into it</span>
<span class="nb">cd </span>newFolder

<span class="c"># Now let&#39;s create a few text files that we can come back to and edit later</span>
touch my-diary.txt foo.txt bar.txt

<span class="c"># Now let&#39;s list the contents of our new folder to ensure our files were created</span>
ls -al</code></pre></div>

<p>At face value, this seems entirely pointless. Why learn commands to do this sort of thing? For starters, you could toss all these commands into a script, add a bit more code and run it on a schedule, creating new folders with files inside them. Similar things are often done in the real world to create log files that we can look back upon when things break.</p>

<p>The thing is, these basic commands are only a start. The tools available to a savvy user are incredibly powerful. Have you ever wanted to separate the videos and images on an SD card into separate folders in one swoop? Maybe find all files in a folder than contain the word ‘taxes?’ You can also build an entire Web application using only the command line. In fact, I have several developer friends who do just that.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t have a book or nerdfriend handy, you can see the ‘manual’ for almost any command by using the <code>man</code> command.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">man ls<span class="p">;</span>
man <span class="nb">cd</span><span class="p">;</span>
man touch<span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c"># Each of the above commands will output a manual for the following command.</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Learning your way around a Linux or Mac command line can ultimately lead to a better day-to-day computing experience. Take it for a spin!</p>
